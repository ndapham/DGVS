# Dynamic Graph Video Synopsis
A method using dynamic graph to solve the task of video synopsis

This is my implementation. 
- Strongly based on what i read from the original and related papers. 

- I filled it with my guesswork and imagination :woozy_face: and it doesn't work at this time :+1:.

- However, this project is still under active development.   

**Update 24/3:**

Complete draft for it but there are some issues about coloring graph and stitching re-arranged tube into synopsis video.
- Coloring graph isn't completed cuz the conditions for picking color are not tight enough.
- Graph adjusting method causes some problems that the new coming tube can collide with the tubes in the output tube list.
